# Contribting to Molo Forms

## Contributing process

If you have found a bug that requires fixing, raise an issue in the github repository.

If you would like to add code and have access, create a PR for that code. We will review that PR and provide feedback. Please ensure that your code has unit tests and has been linted. Once that PR is landed we will make a new release of Molo Forms and you will be listed as a contributor.
