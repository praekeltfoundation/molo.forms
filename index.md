## Molo Forms Documentation
Molo Forms is a form builder based on [Wagtail forms](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/reference/contrib/forms/) with a personalisation element that uses [Wagtail personalisation](https://wagtail-personalisation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Molo forms relies on [Molo](https://github.com/praekeltfoundation/molo/) which is based off [Wagtail](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/). Reading these docs first will help you understand Molo Forms much easier, both as a developer and an editor.

NB! molo.forms only works with molo sites.
